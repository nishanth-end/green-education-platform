  <h2>What this video teaches</h2>
  <p>
    What is it? Oobleck is a "non-Newtonian fluid," meaning its thickness changes based on how much pressure you apply to it.
The "Magic" Trick: If you punch Oobleck or squeeze it quickly, it feels as hard as a brick. But if you dip your fingers in slowly, it feels like gooey, runny water.
Fun Origin: Its funny name comes from the Dr. Seuss book, Bartholomew and the Oobleck, where a sticky green slime falls from the sky.

  <h2>Points to Ponder 🤔</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Why does Oobleck feel like a solid wall when you punch it quickly but like water when you dip your hand in slowly?</li>
    <li>Can you think of other "strange" fluids?</li>
    <li> Could this "liquid armor" be used in the real world?</li>
  </ul>
